This requires downloading the New York City taxi trip dataset from [here](https://archive.org/download/nycTaxiTripData2013). <br> <br>

Ever been stuck somewhere in New York City, wanting to go somewhere but unwilling to wait a long time? Wanting an alternative to ridesharing apps using real taxis?<br>
Our project,<b> TaxiFindMe </b>, will work to solve that. Working with over <b>20 million</b> rides over a period of one year, we present a routing solution fueled by the power of big data 
to find the best place to wait for a taxi based on your location and time of day. Our machine learning algorithms will make sure that we no longer have to waste our time waiting for
taxis that might never come.
